     * A full rotation is expressed as: \f[
     *      2\pi = 6.283185307179586476925...
     * \f]
     * In this implementation it is expressed as \f(6.283185307f\f), or as \f(6.283185307179586476925\f).
     *
     * @tparam TFloatingPointType A floating point type that is expressed as either float or double.
     * @return A full rotation expressed in radians.
