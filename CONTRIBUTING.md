# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

NovelRT is a community-driven project. Contribution is always welcome, and much appreciated.
It is also how it'll be developed.

First, please take a moment to review our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect that all project participants will adhere to it, and any actions taken that go against the Code of Conduct will not be tolerated.

These guidelines are an attempt at better addressing the incoming issues and pull requests. 
Please read them closely, and feel free to ask any questions if needed.

## Getting started
### Submitting Pull Requests

You might know the basics of 
[contributing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and have a fork
[properly set up](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Contribution-Technical-Practices).

You can only create PRs on a dedicated branch.

If you create your own PR, please double check that everything is all right. Also please type what you fixed or added in the PR body,
[for instance](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)

Your PR should be directed to the ```main``` branch - but should start from another fork of this repo.
If you need help / information - please ask for help! Especially if you're a ```first-timer```. 


#### If you contribute to the development, remember to keep this in mind.
[How you build NovelRT](README.md)
We use a code formatter named ```clang-format```, so our codestyle is similar to Microsoft's. 
If you find it hard to adhere to the code style, our CI process will produce a patch for you when neededm so that you can apply it and make your code adherent.

To submit a PR, you must accept the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before the PR can be merged.

### Submitting Issues 
#### If you have a problem, 
Please be so kind as to check if anyone else already have submitted an issue about the same topic.

If you find one, feel free to comment on it so we can know there are multiple people experiencing it.

If didn't find any issue matching yours, then feel free to open an issue.
When you are making an issue, please include these topics if possible:

    When the problem occurs
    What the correct behavior should be
    What the actual behavior is

#### If you are looking for an issue to resolve,
Please feel free to resolve issues with labels like ```help wanted``` or good ```first issue``` even if it isn't your first issue etc. 

If you find an assigned issue that haven't been worked on for some time, then you're allowed to reach out and ask for a reassignment. 

#### Of course, you can always also 
  - Open a GitHub discussion
  - Comment on issues
  - Etc.
