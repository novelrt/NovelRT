# NovelRT
NovelRT is a cross-platform, flexible Visual Novel and 2D game engine. It is aimed at designers and developers alike, however many of the designer tools and features we have on our roadmap have yet to be implemented.

As it currently stands, the C++ LLAPI exists and hopefully soon ink support will slowly start becoming a thing.

For information on ink, check it out from [here](https://github.com/inkle/ink).

## Getting Started with NovelRT

Currently there are no binary distributions of the engine as of yet, and we are still in our early alpha for almost everything. If you wish to attempt to build a basic visual novel with the existing C++ API, you must first `git clone` this repository and set up vcpkg, which you can find out more about [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

### Our dependency list currently includes:
- sdl2
- sdl2-mixer
- sdl2-image
- Lua 5.3
- glad
- glm
- freetype

*The minimum CMake version required for this project is 3.13.*

## Example
Examples will be placed here when we have created some. In the meantime, we advise asking us directly on our discord (invite URL above and below).

## questions?
You can reach us directly via our [discord](https://discord.novelrt.dev/), or you can post your question as an issue on the appropriate repository (but honestly asking us directly might be easier).
