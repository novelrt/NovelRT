NovelRT
=======

NovelRT is a cross-platform, flexible Visual Novel and 2D game engine. It is aimed at designers and developers alike, however many of the designer tools and features we have on our roadmap have yet to be implemented.

## Current Features

Currently, NovelRT supports the following in its base form:
- Graphics LLAPI
- Audio LLAPI

## Future & Immediate Improvements

Current features in development include:
- C++ HLAPI
- Lua 5.3 LLAPI
- CoreCLR hosting
- Ink narrative scripting language support

For information on Ink, check it out from [here](https://github.com/inkle/ink).

## Getting Started with NovelRT

Currently there are no binary distributions of the engine as of yet, and we are still in our early alpha for almost everything.

If you wish to attempt to build a basic visual novel with the existing C++ API, you must first install the following dependencies:

### Dependencies
- .NET SDK 5.0.100
- CMake 3.13
- Doxygen 1.8.8 (if building docs)
- Freetype 2.8.1
- GLAD 0.1.30
- GLFW 3.2.1
- glm
- gtest/gmock 1.10.0
- libpng 1.6.34
- libsndfile 1.0.28
- Lua 5.3
- OpenAL 1.19.1
- spdlog 1.4.2

**If you are compiling on Linux, please note - we do not support GCC at this time. Please use Clang instead.**

### Build instructions

We provide build scripts in the root of the repository which may work for you.
However, you will need to ensure the dependencies are correctly installed.

#### Linux
First, you must install the dependencies. Using Ubuntu 20.04, this looks something like this:
```
sudo apt install clang cmake doxygen graphviz g++ libfreetype-dev libglfw3-dev \
    libglm-dev libgmock-dev libgtest-dev liblua5.3-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile1-dev \
    libspdlog-dev python3-glad
```
Then, clone and build NovelRT:
```
git clone https://github.com/NovelRT/NovelRT.git
mkdir -p NovelRT/build
cd NovelRT/build
cmake ..
make -j
```

#### Windows (x64 only)
_Prerequisites:_  
- You must set up [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-full-installer) and the [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (if you have not done so already).  
- Windows 10 x64  
(32-bit installation _may_ be covered in the future.)

1) Use Python 3 to install the GLAD dependencies:
```
python -m pip install setuptools
python -m pip install glad
```

2) Grab the latest copy of the Windows 64-bit dependencies (called "NovelRTDeps_vcpkg.zip") [here](https://github.com/capnkenny/nrt_vcpkg/releases), as we have already compiled them for you :D  
(A walkthrough on installing manually via vcpkg will be included in the future.)

3) Extract "NovelRTDeps_vcpkg.zip" from Step 3 somewhere accessible _and remember the path_ - you will need it for the next step.
You should be left with a folder called "vcpkg" at this point.

4) Clone and build NovelRT:
```
git clone https://github.com/NovelRT/NovelRT.git
cd NovelRT
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path-from-step-4]/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/toolchain.cmake ..
cmake --build . -j
```
Alternatively, you can also specify a single target to build like so:
```
cmake --build . -j -t TargetNameGoesHere
```

## Example
Examples will be placed here when we have created some. In the meantime, we advise asking us directly on our discord (invite URL above and below).

## Contributing
First off, if you want to contribute, thanks! Tickets that are not being resolved by the development team will be plainly marked as such via `Help Wanted` or something similar to that should it change. We also would greatly appreciate being reached out to via our discord to discuss what you could work on.
