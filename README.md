NovelRT
=======

NovelRT is a cross-platform, flexible Visual Novel and 2D game engine. It is aimed at designers and developers alike, however many of the designer tools and features we have on our roadmap have yet to be implemented.

## Current Features

Currently, NovelRT supports the following in its base form:
- Graphics LLAPI
- Audio LLAPI

## Future & Immediate Improvements

Current features in development include:
- C++ HLAPI
- Fabulist narrative scripting language support

For information on Fabulist, check it out from [here](https://github.com/novelrt/fabulist).

## Getting Started with NovelRT

Currently there are no binary distributions of the engine as of yet, and we are still in our early alpha for almost everything.

If you wish to attempt to build a basic visual novel with the existing C++ API, you must first install the following dependencies:

### Dependencies
- CMake 3.18
- Doxygen 1.8.8 (if building docs)
- Freetype 2.8.1
- GLFW 3.3.2
- glm
- gtest/gmock 1.10.0
- libpng 1.6.34
- libsndfile 1.0.28
- Microsoft GSL 3.1.0
- OneTBB 2021.3.0
- OpenAL 1.21.1
- spdlog 1.8.2
- Vulkan SDK 1.2.170.0 (if you require debug/validation layers)
- Vulkan Loader 1.2.182
- Vulkan Memory Allocator 2.3.0 (not directly used currently, but will be used in a future update)

**If you are compiling on Linux, please note - we do not support GCC at this time. Please use Clang instead. Please also note all supported compiler profiles can be found [here.](https://github.com/novelrt/ConanConfig) Contributions for new profiles are welcome, however we will only be accepting profiles for first-party platforms.**

### Build instructions

These instructions are based on the Conan package manager. you can download Conan from [here.](https://conan.io/)

#### Linux
First, you must install the dependencies. Using Ubuntu 20.04 there are extra requirements on top of Conan. With those dependencies, it looks something like this:
```
sudo apt install clang  libgl-dev xorg-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-render-util0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev \
libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-sync-dev \
libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev xkb-data libxcb-dri3-dev libxcb-util-dev python3-pip \
```

Then, install Conan and our configurations should you require them:
```
pip3 install conan
conan config install https://github.com/novelrt/ConanConfig.git
```

If you are building from a command line terminal, clone NovelRT and set up the build folder like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/NovelRT/NovelRT.git
mkdir -p NovelRT/build
cd NovelRT/build
conan install .. --build=missing --build=bison --profile linux-clang10-amd64
```

Then you should be able to configure and build the default setup, like so:
```
conan build .. --build-folder .
```

If you would like to change any of the settings prior to building, pass them in like so:
```
conan build .. --build-folder . -o NovelRT:buildtests=False -o NovelRT:documentation=False -o NovelRT:buildsamples=False
```
(Please note: the above command shows the only four options we support at the moment - anything else is considered unsupported at this time.)

If you would like to build using CMake instead, you can configure and build, like so:
```
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j
```

#### Windows (x64 only)
_Prerequisites:_
- You must set up [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-full-installer) and the [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (if you have not done so already).
- Windows 10 x64

(32-bit installation _may_ be covered in the future.)

Please download [Python 3 (x64) from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from the Microsoft Store. Once that is done,
install conan and our configurations should you require them:
```
pip install conan
conan config install https://github.com/novelrt/ConanConfig.git
```

If you are building from a command line terminal, clone NovelRT and set up the build folder like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/NovelRT/NovelRT.git
cd NovelRT
mkdir build
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing --profile windows-vs2019-amd64
```

Then you should be able to configure and build the default setup, like so:
```
conan build .. --build-folder .
```

If you would like to change any of the settings prior to building, pass them in like so:
```
conan build .. --build-folder . -o NovelRT:buildtests=False -o NovelRT:documentation=False -o NovelRT:buildsamples=False
```
(Please note: the above command shows the only four options we support at the moment - anything else is considered unsupported at this time.)

If you would like to build using CMake instead, you can configure and build, like so:
```
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j
```

#### Visual studio 2019 specific instructions

When you open the NovelRT folder in VS2019 for the first time the CMakeSettings.json file will contain incorrect values.
Change the buildRoot value to `${projectDir}\\build` and the installRoot to `${projectDir}\\install` and restart Visual Studio this will make sure that it uses the same build path as the CLI commands.
You can delete the `out` folder in the NovelRT root as well as we won't use it anymore.
Afterwards right click on the `conanfile.py` file in the root and click the `Run conan install windows-vs2019-amd64` option.
This runs the conan install command from the section above to regenerate the files we need to build with cmake as Visual Studio wiped the output from earlier.
Then regenerate the cmake by clicking regenerate on the yellow warning ribbon on the top of Visual Studio.

## Example
Examples will be placed here when we have created some. In the meantime, we advise asking us directly on our discord (invite URL above and below).

## Contributing
First off, if you want to contribute, thanks! Tickets that are not being resolved by the development team will be plainly marked as such via `Help Wanted` or something similar to that should it change. We also would greatly appreciate being reached out to via our discord to discuss what you could work on.
